Enhancing Character Recognition OCR (using Pytesseract) with AI LLM (LLaMa3)
Steps : Making a CRUD using Flask and VueJs ---> Change the interface so the user enters a picture, the picture gets stored in the database --> An AI OCR model scans the picture using API which is Pytesseract and then the text is sent back to the backend to be displayed to the user --> A LLM model is used to fix misspelling and missing words which is LLaMa3
